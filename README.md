This python script is an open source library that helps you scrape news from over 10 online english written newspapers and blogs for a particular organisation or brand and can run sentiment analysis to 
tell you how the brand is percieved in the news today.

Most recent developments to this library will allow you scrape news from various news papers and blogs across the world and we hope that you use
the corpus you generate to do some awesome machine learning tasks.
